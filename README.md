RDLC-Pdf-Generator
==================

This project is a utility that uses Microsoft .Net's client reporting libraries to create Pdf files in code. Extra instructions on how to use this approach to create documents can be found on my blog:  http://blog.davehawes.com/post/2012/08/10/Create-Pdf-or-Word-documents-with-standard-Net-libraries.aspx
